## Introduction :
You have just moved into the town of Animal Villa! Introductions can be hard, but your neighbors seem friendly. Choose how you interact with your fellow animal friends and make meaningful relationships! Beware of creating a bad reputation for yourself, and make sure to keep track of your finances. There are a lot of new faces to see, places to visit, and connections to be made!

   - Given two choices on the screen
   - When a player wants to make a choice
   - The player will swipe left for NO and right for YES

### Requirement 2 :
As a PLAYER I want TO BE ABLE TO SAVE MY PROGRESS 
So that I can STOP PLAYING MY GAME WHEN I WANT TO/NOT LOSE PROGRESS
Given I PLAYED THIS GAME FOR A BIT
When I EXIT THE GAME/ CLOSE THE APPF
Then MY GAME PROGRESS IS SAVED

### Requirement 3 :
As a PLAYER I want TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE SETTINGS
So that I can BE COMFORTABLE WHILE PLAYING MY GAME
Given THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD
When I OPEN SETTINGS
Then I AM ABLE TO CHANGE THE VOLUME
